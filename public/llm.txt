# TL;HM (Too Long; Had Machine)

A blog about cognitive compilation - transforming scattered thoughts into coherent strategy through human-AI collaboration.

## Purpose
This blog documents the evolution of thought partnership between humans and AI, specifically exploring Claude Code as a "cognitive compiler" rather than just a coding tool.

## Key Themes
- Cognitive compilation: AI as thought partner, not just code generator
- Mobile-first AI workflows: Development anywhere, thinking everywhere  
- Prose-focused writing: Flowing intellectual discourse without excessive structure
- Executive translation: Converting technical insights into strategic frameworks

## Technical Stack
- Built with Astro and styled with Chiri theme
- Deployed on Vercel with ISR for performance
- Written collaboratively with Claude Code
- Obsidian integration via black-iris MCP server for knowledge management
- black-iris enables Claude Code to search, analyze, and synthesize thousands of notes

## Content Philosophy
Every article is co-thought, not just AI-assisted. The writing process itself demonstrates the cognitive compilation principle - human intent compiled through AI collaboration into refined prose.

## Author
Terry Li - Using AI to augment thinking, not replace it.

## Context
This blog serves as both demonstration and documentation of advanced AI partnership patterns. It's not about what AI can do for us, but what we can think together.

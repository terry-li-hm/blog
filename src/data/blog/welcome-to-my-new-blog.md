Hello and welcome! I'm excited to launch my new personal blog at blog.homing.li.

This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on technology, development insights, and various ideas that interest me. The blog is built with Astro and uses the AstroPaper theme, which provides great features like search, dark mode, and excellent performance.

## What to Expect

- Technical articles and tutorials
- Development experiences and lessons learned
- Thoughts on emerging technologies
- Occasional personal reflections

Feel free to check out my [professional CV](https://homing.li) if you're interested in my background.

Stay tuned for more content!

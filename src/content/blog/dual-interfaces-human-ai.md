  We're building parallel interfaces for the same functionality because humans

My blog publisher has two faces. Through the CLI, I type `clio publish` and watch colorful output stream past, confirmation messages that make me feel in control. Through MCP, Claude calls `publish_essay()` and receives structured JSON, no colors needed. Same functionality. Different species of user. This isn't redundancy - it's evolution.

We used to debate CLI versus GUI. Now we're architecting something stranger: parallel infrastructures for carbon and silicon users. Every tool splitting into two paths, like light through a prism, each wavelength optimized for different kinds of perception.

The CLI speaks human. Progress bars because we need to see movement. Colored output because our pattern recognition evolved for a world of meaning through hue. Verbose confirmations because we distrust what we cannot see happening. `--help` flags written in prose because we parse intent through narrative.

The MCP speaks machine. JSON responses because structure is meaning. No progress bars because async promises are the only timeline that matters. Silent success because exceptions are the only information worth transmitting. Documentation as schema because types are more precise than prose.

I watched myself building this duality into my blog publisher without planning it. The human side got prettier while the machine side got more atomic. Not because I decided to segregate interfaces, but because the physics of interaction demanded it. Humans need to feel the tool working. AI needs to know it worked.

This isn't about backwards compatibility. We're not maintaining legacy human interfaces while building for an AI future. We're recognizing that both interfaces are primary, serving constituents who inhabit the same systems through fundamentally different phenomenologies.

When GitHub Copilot reads my code, it doesn't see syntax highlighting. When I read the same code, the colors are load-bearing. The code hasn't changed, but it exists differently for each of us. We're building Schr√∂dinger's interfaces - simultaneously optimized for observers who collapse different aspects of the wave function.

The pattern extends beyond developer tools. Notion has an API for agents and a canvas for humans. Stripe has a dashboard for humans and webhooks for machines. Every service sprouting dual interfaces, not as redundancy but as recognition that we're serving two species of user who parse reality through different grammars.

What fascinates me is where these interfaces diverge. Humans want confirmation; machines want idempotency. Humans need metaphors; machines need contracts. Humans parse meaning through journey; machines parse through state.

The MCP protocol isn't just another API standard. It's acknowledgment that AI agents deserve their own ergonomics. Not anthropomorphized interfaces that pretend machines think like us, but genuinely alien interfaces optimized for genuinely alien cognition.

I'm writing this essay on a tool that bridges both worlds. Claude Code provides me a terminal interface while orchestrating MCP calls beneath. I see what I need to see. It sees what it needs to see. We're collaborating through parallel realities, each optimized for our respective phenomenologies.

The future isn't "AI-first" or "human-centered" design. It's building for a world where every tool serves two masters with fundamentally different ways of knowing. Where every function has two signatures. Where every action has two representations.

We're not replacing human interfaces with machine ones. We're discovering that reality itself needs multiple interfaces, each revealing different aspects of the same underlying truth. The CLI and MCP aren't competing standards - they're complementary lenses for a world becoming too complex for any single way of seeing.

P.S. Yesterday I caught myself explaining to Claude how to use a tool I built. Then I realized - I wasn't teaching it the CLI commands. I was describing the MCP schema. We've crossed a threshold where tools need documentation in two languages, for two kinds of mind. The manual has evolved into the manual and the schema. Both necessary. Neither sufficient alone.
